# TDD

### The 3 Rules of TDD

1. Do not write any production code without a failing test first.
2. Write only enough test code as is sufficient enough to fail.
3. Only Implement minimal code that makes the failing test pass.

---

### Motivation

- Enforces you better know the architecture / structure of the production code youâ€™re going to write and better plan everything in advance.
- Help to produce more efficient production code.
- Creates low level documentation for the code.
