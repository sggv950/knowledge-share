# FizzBuzz TDD

## Let's write FizzBuzz in TDD

[Fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a group word game for children to teach them about division.
Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word "fizzbuzz"

### Exercise
The exercise is complete when the following input:

`[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15]`

results in the following output:

`[1, 2, 'fizz', 'buzz', 'fizz', 'buzz', 'fizzbuzz']`
