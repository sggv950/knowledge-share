# Clean TDD

- A Dual Standard
- One assert per test
- Single concept per test

### F.I.R.S.T

**FAST** - Test should run quickly! Slow and heavy tests tend to be ignored and left unmaintained eventually.

**INDEPENDENT** - Tests should be run independently and run in any order.

**REPEATABLE** - Test should run in any environment: production, QA, local or even without network.

**SELF-VALIDATING** - Test should have Boolean output. Either they pass or fail.

**TIMELY** - Test need to be written just before production code. When writing test after production code you might find out itâ€™s really hard to test.
